'normal' -- this VLAN is a normal VLAN (i.e., not a 
            private VLAN or private group).

'primary' -- this VLAN is the primary VLAN as defined for
             Private VLAN feature.

'isolated' -- this VLAN is the isolated VLAN as
              defined for Private VLAN feature. All the 
              ports in the isolated VLAN can only talk 
              to the specifically designated ports 
              configured as promiscuous ports, i.e., 
              the ports even in the same isolated VLAN 
              can not talk to each other. 

              Promiscuous ports are the ports that
              are performing the L2 mapping of the 
              secondary VLANs (isolated, community, 
              twoWayCommunity VLANs)  to their 
              associated primary VLANs. Promiscuous 
              ports with cpvlanPromPortTwoWayRemapCapable 
              values of true(1) can also perform the L2 
              mapping of primary VLANS to the 
              twoWayCommunity (5) VLANs associated with 
              them.

 'community' -- this VLAN is the community VLAN as
               defined for Private VLAN feature. All the 
               ports in this community VLAN can behave 
               like ports in normal VLAN type except 
               that they can also receive egress packets 
               tagged with its associated primary VLAN 
               ID. 

 'twoWayCommunity' -- this VLAN is the twoWayCommunity
               VLAN as defined for Private VLAN feature.
               All the ports in this twoWayCommunity VLAN
               behave the same as ports in community(4)
               VLAN. Promiscuous ports with  
               cpvlanPromPortTwoWayRemapCapable value
               of true can also perform the L2 mapping 
               from primary VLANs to the twoWayCommunity
               VLANs associated with them.
